Codestar.me - Built with AWS CodeStar
=====================================

This is just a simple online copy-paste tool, placeholder for a üòé domain name I have bought some time ago.

There are many tools like this, so now, there is one more. Enjoy. 

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is quickly made, not following best practices, for myself and WIP (probably will always be). Expect bad user experience. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

AWS Codestar
------------
This AWS tool gave me an idea for the domain name, and I was thinking it would be cool to make it with it.

### Experience

Like every abstraction tool, it gives you speed for simple things. I wouldn't try for something more serious than this.
